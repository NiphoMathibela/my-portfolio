      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of the University of Johannesburg, where I earned a Diploma in Business
        Information Technology. My studies equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of both
        IT infrastructure and business operations, preparing me to bridge the gap between these two
        critical domains. I am highly motivated and eager to apply my theoretical knowledge and
        practical skills to contribute to a dynamic organization.
