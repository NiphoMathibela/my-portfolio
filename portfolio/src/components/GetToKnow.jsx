      <p>
        I am a third year university student studying IT, I have already gained a strong foundation in software development
        and a strong passion for creating innovative solutions.
        I am constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies in the industry. Not only am I a hard worker and dedicated to delivering quality work, but I also have a laid back and humorous personality that makes me a great team player.
